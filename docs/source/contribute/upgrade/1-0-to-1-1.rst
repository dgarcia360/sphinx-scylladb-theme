=========================

This guide explains how to upgrade the version of the Scylla Sphinx Theme.

How to check your current theme version
---------------------------------------

The theme version is displayed in the footer of the project's documentation site.

If your project theme's version is <1.0, follow this guide to get the latest version.

Upgrade to version 1.1
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.0 and 1.1 versions.

#. Set ``sphinx-scylladb-theme`` in ``docs/pyproject.toml`` to ``sphinx-scylladb-theme = "~1.1.0"``.

#. In ``conf.py``, remove the option ``html_theme_options`` from ``html_theme_options``.

	.. note:: Depending on your project configuration, you may find ``conf.py`` under ``docs/source/conf.py`` or ``docs/conf.py``.

#. With 1.1, you can configure the layout of a specific page. For example, if you are using a home page created with topic boxes as explained in the :doc:`previous upgrade guide <0-x-to-1-0>`, we recommend you to add the following lines at the beginning of your root ``index.rst`` file:

	.. code-block:: rst

		:full-width:
		:hide-version-warning:
		:hide-pre-content:
		:hide-post-content:
		:landing:
