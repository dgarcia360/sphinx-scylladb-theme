Pull requests previews
======================

.. caution:: This feature is only available for a selected number of projects.

We use a custom Jenkins pipeline to automatically generate a preview site for the documentation on every pull request that modifies the docs folder.

To request activation of this feature for your ScyllaDB project, `open an issue on this repository <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-pkg/>`_ in this repository and ask to enable the pull request preview feature.
